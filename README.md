# TilingProject
For the course 'Heuristics' at the VU Amsterdam we designed three algorithms with different heuristics, in order to determine a better constructive algorithm to solve the tiling problem. The tiling problem consists of a given set of fields, with each their own specific set of tiles, where each field needs to be solved by placing each tile on the field in such way that the whole field is covered and there is no overlap amongst the tiles. 
For each field, there is at least one solution. Given for
this assignment are 125 tile set configurations. This is a total of 25 configurations of sets of
approximately 15 to 55 tiles, with increments of 10 tiles. This project will focus on implementing a
chosen type of algorithm and research on the impacts of heuristics on the algorithm's capabilities
on solving the tiling problem.
